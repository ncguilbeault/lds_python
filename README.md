Linear dynamical systems in Python ![lint+unitTests](https://github.com/joacorapela/ssm/actions/workflows/lint+unitTests.yml/badge.svg) ![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/)
----------------------------------

- documentation, including the [API specification](https://joacorapela.github.io/ssm/modules.html) and sphinx-gallery scripts demonstrating the use of linear dynamical systems for linear regression, kinematics inference, and neural latents inference appears [here](https://joacorapela.github.io/ssm/index.html).

- derivations of the Kalman filter matrices used for tracking appear [here](docs/tracking/tracking.pdf).

and there is more to come ...
